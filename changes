2Dreams 1.9.10
==============

This version of 2Dreams is supposed to have the same functionality than the
previous version. This is the first version though, that FULLY relies on the
draldb library. The ad-hoc internal 2Dreams dbase has been completelly removed
in a three-step process (versions 1.9.8 => 1.9.10).

Warning !!
==========

1) This migration process ment a lot of changes in the 2Dreams code: ~6500 code lines have
   been striped out from 2Dreams and a lot of minor changes on the remaing code have been
   done to accomodate with the draldb API. THIS MEANS THAT THIS VERSION IS LIKELY TO
   HAVE NEW BUGS. PLEASE IF YOU NOTICE ANY ODD BEHAVIOR REPORT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
   
2) Since the draldb library has a generic purpose API it is not as efficient as the ad-hoc
   dbase 2Dreams had in the past. I'll keep working to enhance loading performance.

Added automatic search to see if core libraries are available in
the directory ../asim-core. This eliminates the need for an
explict specification of the --with-asim-core-dir swtich to

2Dreams 1.9.16
==============

Removed all the structures related with MoveItems on Column Descriptors.
This means that now, the only data managed by 2Dreams itself is the
computed color and shape of each event on screen (and disassembly tabs).
All other Dral information is been managed by draldb. 

This means removing redundancy and hence less memory footprint than
previous version.

2Dreams 1.9.19
==============

  - Changed all the ADF IO management:

    - Changed the subprocess mechanism. Now ANY kind of binary can be used to produce the ADF.
      If the ADF is a txt file and starts  w/ '#!' or ':' it is processed as a program. If the
      file has execution flags it is ALWAYS processed as a program. The only thing 2Dreams
      relies on is that the stdout of the executed program must be the final adf.

    - Added support for embedded ADFs. Embedded ADFs can be either a plain xml file or a script.
      Embedded scripted ADFs MUST use the '#!' or ':' notation. You cannot embbed a binary into
      the drl file. 2Dreams will select an appropiated adf with the following precedence rules:
        1. The command line adf (if any)
        2. The embedded adf (if any)
        3. The default configured adf (2Dreams preferences).

      !!! Current TWD/Vx86 traces already have embedded adf's so you do NOT need to include the
      ADF explicitely anymore!!!
    
Be aware that any file with execution flags will be trated as a binary adf. Make sure
your plain xml adf do NOT have execution flags, otherwhise you will get an error 
message.

2Dreams 1.9.20
==============

  - fixed a bug in the draldb initialization process. I was initializing only the first
    slot (BW Slots) for edge-rows.

  - fixed a tricky bug in the synchronization between draldb and 2Dreams duirng
    the transition form the dral header (dral-graph + embedded adf) to the
    activity section (cycle, settag, moteitem, etc).

  - fixed a bug in the "pending moveitems" count mechanism that was leading to
    auto-compression mechanism to be triggered before the right moment 
    (all moveitems commited) in some traces.

2Dreams 1.9.21
==============

  - detected a problem loading some traces. 2Dreams get stalled and the EOF
    event. the problem is that some traces have a complete list
    of deleteitems at the end of the drl. Starting from 0 and until the last
    created item in the trace, no matter the deleteitem was performed before
    or not. This erroneous and huge (in some cases millions) list of deleteitems 
    trashes the internal item_id cache (max 10.000 deleteitems at once) and therefore 
    O(n) look-ups are performed.
    
    Even though this is a bug in the model I added a bunch of workarrounds in 2Dreams
    to speed-up this since model debugging is likely to take a while. I switched the deletelist from
    FValueVector template to AEVector to avoid grow&copy() operations of dynamic arrays. I changed
    also some methods to avoid uneeded O(n) look-ups and finally added a special version
    of the computeDeleteItems() methods for the cases where nitems is bigger than 1000.
    This long version puts a progress dialog and play some tricks to reduce as much as
    possible O(n) look-ups.

2Dreams 2.0.pre1
================

Here it is! A *preliminar* version of 2Dreams 2 is up & running.
This version is a little bit unstable though so your feedback
on bug report is very important.

- What's new:
  - Visualization of node rows and node tags.
    - Simple coloring supported: node rows will show and event for
      each cycle unless some color rules set it to transparent.
      
    - Generic Shading  supported: any node row can set a shading color
      instead of a plain color. You can reproduce ADF1 occupancy rows with
      this more general feature. Mutiple shading table definitions are
      supported. If both plain and shaded color is defined for a node
      row, the shaded takes precedence no matter the declaration order.
      Transparent color rules will be ignored if shading table is used.
      Any node tag can be used to determine the color on a cycle basis.
      The valid range of values is [0..nodecapacity] by default and can
      be overrided with integer constants in the ADF.
      
    - Arbitrary use of shapes on node rows. Both with plain and shaded
      colors (so now you can hace shaded circles, diamonds, etc).
    
    - Arbitrary mixing of node and edge rows. So you can have your
      place occupancy rows just nearby the edge related rows of in
      any way that makes sense to your model/task.
    
    - Arbitrary repetition of node rows (with potentially different rules)
      supported.
       
- Fixes: a bunch of bug fixes of all sorts.

- Note: 2Dreams 2.0 is supposed to be 100% compatible with drl 1.x/ADF1.x
        files. By now, though, ADF1 occupancy rows are ignored so you need
        to upgrade your adf (and model to put node tags) if you want them
        back.
    
- What is not implemented yet:
  - Cycle tags and all its uses.
  - Overriding max/min value on shaded rows using a tag value instead of
    an ADF constant.
  - enter/exit node rows
  - grouping of rows
  - node slot support
  - programable background colors
  - nodetag support outside node rows (for global scope ifs)
  - dtd 2.0 (so no dtd checking available)
     
- Known bugs:
  - the new ADF2 parser is not that robust nor friendly, be sure to make
    your ADF2 carefully.
    
  - some twd16 drl files trigger some asserts...

  - Adding row info in the context popup menu (right click on the event area)
  	This includes both edge and node rows. By now the given info is very simple.
	Color/Shape evaluation is given for shaded rows only. Complete Color/Shape
	explanation comming soon.

  - Fixed several incoherences with the activation/deactivation of menu options when some
	file is open/closed. This implied to create a new helper class Q2DAction in AGT.

  - Added an option under tools menu to dump out the used ADF (is not easely available when you just
  	get a drl file with an embedded adf...).
    
  - Fixed a problem in the reset mechanism on RowDescriptor class.
  
  - Fixed an uninitialized var on ShowTags::showItemTags() and changed a debuging printf() by a
    dump on the log file.
    
  - Fixed a small bug in the ADF2 parser that was producing seg.fault if you include a <node>
    statement referring to an unknown dral node.
    
  - Changed the way non-existing edges and rows are managed by the adf parsers (versions 1 & 2)
    to avoid creating fake nodes and edges.

  - added syntax highlighting to "show ADF" option. 
  - renew the icons and the general look&feel of the application
  - added a counter to avoid putting too many warnings aboyt invalid shading conditions on node rows (no tag or out of range)
  - alphabetical sorting of tags on find/ancestor dialogs.
  - changed the grid-line implementation: now it can be independently activated for horizontal an vertical lines and is always
  a multiple of the event size.
  - fixed a bug related with double-click on elements of the "tag docked window" if the element was not a mutable tag
  an assert was raised. 
  - fixed lack of adaptability to resize events on all dialogs
  - added multiple line string tag support
  - added support (in 2Dreams and DralDB ) to TAG long descriptions

added the new (based on qt 3.2) help viewr. this is actually a tiny
web browser that downloads the current 2dream web help page. This was
hard to integrate due to some obscure QT interactions between the network
and the GUI objects (both use the same event queue). I've been hacking
a lot to get this working but I'm not 100% sure this will work in all the
cases. If you decect a crash/bug please report!

- rolled back help viewer to local system file only
- Fixed a bug in CSLEngine regarding shaded rows
- Added initial support for MDI, the lead to some discussion with some of the local users
  about the best GUI approach. Several tweaking and hacking on libAGT and 2Dreams itself was 
  necessary to make all the dialogs and features MDI aware. By now, multiple views 
  of the SAME drl file is supported only (multiple files could be added later). 
  In this commit the MDI are completely independent (in terms of highlighting, shading, etc). This will
  be refined in the next commits.

  - Implemented Scroll & Zoom global lock/unlock for MDI, scrolling is propagated proportionally if the scale is
  different on each window. zoom in/out is propagated accordingly, zooming a specific rectangle is NOT propagated
  - fixed some refresh artifacts with ballons and distance/zoom tools
  - Implemented free (rebel) mdi windows (do not obey global lock/unlock nor propagate their events)
  - Fixed a bug related with closing MDI windows (different behavior if clicking on the x button or the "close" option
    in the main menu).
  - propagate MDI number to MDI (caption) docked windows so they can float on the desktop without ambiguity
  - improved drawing precision of some primitives (triangle and rhomb)
  - added some MDI management shortcuts

  - added zoom on new window tool which is equivalent to the zooming a rectangle but instead of 
    zooming the selection regions, it creates a new window with that region. 
    
  - improved and optimized the repainting algorithm. Mainly'cause I gonna implement
  the panning docked window soon which requieres fast refreshing with very far views. Now 2Dreams has tree drawing modes: 
     - full scale: complete (normal) drawing 
     - border: when the internal size of the computed square is less than a pixel I switch to draw the border only
     - point with subsampling: when the size of the computed square is equal to a pixel or less I draw only points and
     steping by n where n is the floor of (1.0/sc)/ss. (sc=scalling factor, ss=square size). I do this 'case when scalling
     is so small (very far views) than more than one event get mapped to the same pixel, is not worth drawing ALL the 
     events and hence the "sub"sampling.
  Now 2Dreams dynamicaly computes the boundary scalling factors in order to decide one of the tree drawing modes.
  Very noticable speedups are achieved when the subsampling factor is big (i.e. 8:1 or higher).

- fixed a few qt 3.2.x ONLY calls that were preventing 2Dreams to compile on a std RH9 (qt 3.1)
installation. Those QT 3.2 only calls have 3.1 copatible equivalents so now 2Dreams compiles
again on both 3.1.x and 3.2.x
- added lock/unlock of row shading, by default is locked 
- added lock/unlock for highlighting, by default is locked
- update "save session" functionality so that now you save the "session" of the active MDI if
more than one window is open.
- fixed some small GUI errors with MDI (propagation of cursor & messages)

implemted:
- with the GUI disabled just to test the correct state of the
  database and canvas.
- with the GUI enabled to test both the correct state of
  the database and that the X doesn't crash.

Alse a new class parses the command line paramaters and provides
its values to 2Dreams.

   Added a new tool: TDreams. This one is still immature.
The purpose of this tool is to analyze transaction behavior
by showing the nodes where an item related with a transaction
spent its lifetime. It allows the user to define a transaction,
to show its items, to show the longest transactions, to filter
the transactions (e.g. it can show only read transactions that
missed in the cache), dump stripcharts, ... (more to come). 
Text output, nothing fancy.

   The application is pretty general (no hardcoded assumptions), 
and some of its parts can be easily added/modified (i.e. filters
are specified with an XML language).

   Not integrated -> has to be manually compiled. It requires
Loki lib (sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib MIT License)
 to be compiled and it's not installed.

- Added the new version of dreams application compoosed by the already existing
  2Dreamsn view and the new 3Dreams view.  - The commited version of the Dreams
  application has the following features implemented:

  * New 3Dreams view. This view is a representation in the space of the
    specifyed nodes. This view is animated along the time displaying the items that
    are inside the displayed nodes. This implementation of 3Dreams is conceptually
    based on the already commited code named 3Dreams, but it has no other relation
    with it.
  
  * New ADF 2.5 that supports the new 3Dreams view configuration
  
  * Some synchronization between the 2Dreams and the new 3Dreams views.
  
- Note that this is only the first commit, but the status of the application is
  still under hard development.

 Copied the last version of draldb to the directory dDB in the Dreams code. This
 change should prevent the breacking of the current code of 2Dreams, and will make
 more easy the transition from 2Dream application to the Dreams.

 Since now, the library draldb will support the 2Dreams application, and will only be midifyed
 to correct bugs. The unestable code will live inside the dDB directory in Dreams.

Added support for the new DRAL Trace header that has a tar comment
Also a manager for temporary files has been added to ease the use
and deletion of temporary files.
Also is debugged a problem with some cases where the program gets
in an infinite loop when the back-propagation is disabled.

 - Corrected the build process of 2Dreams.
 - Now the 3Dreams window cannot be opened if the XML doesn't define the 3Dreams view
 - Changed the open drl file behaviour. Now, when you try to open a drl file and you
   have any file loaded, first of all, all the windows are closed and all the databases
   reset.
 - Implemented the posibility of going to a given cycle in the 3Dreams view using the
   "Go to cycle" dialog.
 - Disabled in the 3Dreams the highlight menu that changes which elements are shown (the
   highlighted, the no highlighted or all of them). By default 3Dreams shows all of them.
   This behaviour should be discussed in the future.

dDB has been modified to support multiple instances. The main changes are
the deletation of the getInstance calls of the classes that where singleton
(except the log manager that is usefull to be shared among all the instances
of dDB and DralDB itself that is not changed to avoid changing all Dreams
code that use the getInstance of this class).
Only the creators of the classes have been changed to add pointers to the
ex singleton classes that they need. Some classes needed some hacks because
they were instanciated using AEVectors or such auxiliar template structures
that aren't able to create an object with specific parameters, so after the
allocation of a new position the pointers are set manually...

Some new features added into the dDB:
 - Now the access to the items is direct, not using a look-up cache or
   other auxiliar structures. This change fastens up the item search
   process.
 - The Item database has been extended to store more type of events, not
   only tags: move items, enter nodes, ...
 - The ItemHandler API has some changes to make it more clear and smooth 
   (some Dreams classes have been changed to adapt to the new names).

Solved a bug in Dreams that caused infinite loop when the backpropagate
flag is disabled.

This is a partial commit of the deletion of the live database
and the change of the 2Dreams view infrastructure.

Almost all the code of the live database is moved to another
classes, and just a few last parts must be deleted or moved
to finally erase this structure. Actually, the new computing
system has some performance problems that will be solved in
future commits.

The 2Dreams infrastructure is being gradually coded to see if
it matches with the previous infrastructure. In this commit
some classes have been added with just basic functionality.

 - Continued the work of eliminating the ConfigDB and ZDBase, and moving all
   their functionality to Layout2D class hierarchy. All the Item window data
   have been moved from ConfigDB to Layout2D.

 - Implemented the new signal synchronization between the different dreams
   views. It also support the future waterfall and 4Dreams views.

 - Improved the selection mechanism in the 3D Item window. Now when an
   element is selected, the view jump into the cycle and the coordinates
   where the item can be viewed.

 - Bug correction:
    * Enabled again the 3D video controls, in a previous commit they were
      deactivated.
      
    * Corrected some weird bug that made the app crash when an item
      was selected in the item window.

All the tag vector have been slightly redecoded to fasten up the search
functions and also the classes have been renamed. A new bundle of tag vector
(TagVecValue8XXX) have been added to support values of 8 bits.
A new type of class (TagHandler) has been added to perform sequential access
to the values of a tag of a given track. This class behave similar to the
ItemHandler class.
All the live database code is almost deleted and some minor changed to other
dDB classes have been done.

The compute of colors has been changed in chunks of cycles, so all the process
is now faster.

 - This commit wants to be a milestone just before the final migration of the
   class ConfigDB to the Layout2D. In this commit they both exists and both are
   functional.  The classes that used ConfigDB now use the Layout2D hierarchy
   class or access their functionality using the DreamsDB as an interface.
 
 - Some other classes (fvaluevector, DreamsDB) have been modifyed in order to
   made their interface more coherent with the rest of classes or to imitate
   the Qt interface.

 - Corrected tehe bug that prevented the display of the 3dreams events
 - Deleted the major part of the references to ConfigDB in the code. It
   only remains in the LiveDB. We kept this reference because the LiveDB
   class is going to be deleted soon.

 - Renamed the LayoutDB and all its class hierarchy renamed to Layout3D
   class hierarchy.
 - Moved the 2Dreams painting process from TwoDAvtView class to Layout2D
   classes. The old painting methods are still in the class, but the are
   going to be deleted in next commits. 
   With this change we give support for fold/unfold groups of rows.

- The LiveDB have been finally deleted from all the Dreams infrastructure. Now
  all the event computing is done without the use of this class.
- Also the ConfigDB and its partners DralGraphNode and DralGraphEdge have been
  fully deleted, so now Layout2D is the only class used.
- Some other classes have been changed in order to adapat some function name
  changes.

 - All the computation of the colors have been redesigned to all
   the Layout2D classes.
 - Results of the rules computation like color, shape, letter, etc
   is done using a new class called CSLData.
 - The color and shape result is now stored in the DralDB, not the
   ZDBase (maintained to check coherency with previous results).

   the Layout3D class hierarchy.
 - Added the support in the 3D classes to store the color in the DralDB.
 - Minor bug correction in the 2D classes.

 - A new callback to undefine values of slots has been added into the dralDB.
   By now only TagVecValue31* implements this callback.
 - Using this new feature, TagVecValue31* has been changed to behave as a forwarding
   vector, so the enter and exit nodes are easily implemented. The moveitems have
   been implemented with a set in the actual cycle plus an undefine in the following
   one.

- Debugged the Expression* to evaluate correctly. Now these classes
  appear to work correctly.

- A first version of the type checking also added to them. It's still
  under development and also are not called in the ADF parsers.

- Also the compute masking has been added, but still not tested. Maybe
  the more important performance hint in the dreams code!

- ADFParser1 and ADFParser2 modified to create the expressions instead
  of the old row rules. Still some more code to add.

This is a partial commit, so dreams might (will) not work!

 ItemTagHeap.h             Locally Modified          95

- Important changes done in the ItemTagHeap: now the tags are stored in cycle
  order and not in tag order. This will ease and speed up some other processes
  like reuse the item tag vectors if one item stays more than one cycle in one
  slot.

- Also the API of ItemHandler has been slightly modified to adapt to this new
  behaviour (now an ItemHandler doesn't point to a tag, it points to a value
  of a tag in one cycle). Due this change, some classes have been modified to
  adapt to the new API. Some of them need to be revised in order to work correctly
  again.

- Expression type checking now seems to work correctly, but still is not fully
  debugged.

- Expression evaluation now uses the computation mask that prunes expression
  branches that won't change any value. Seems that the compute process have speed
  up considerably, but the exact X is unknown by now because we are still in
  developement and debugging.

 - Distributing across Layout2D, DralDB and DreamsDB classes the functionality
   of ZDBase in order to ease the elimination of ZDBase. All the basic 
   functionality (color storage) has been already moved to DralDB.

 - Current version is not fully stable, so it can crash with many Dral traces

- Added the new classes to do shading tables. ExpressionLookUp computes
  the evaluation of the index and the ADFMap* store the different values
  for a defined map table.

- Modified the parsers to generate this new classes and also debugged some
  memory leakage in case that the generation of an expression was cancelled.

- Debugged some errors in some Expressions.

- Now the row nodes also are computed using the Expressions.

 - Corrected a bug in the getTagById method. Now it leaves the pointer in the
   found tag (Guillem)
 - Fully eliminated the ZDBase from Dreams. A lot of functionality migration 
   from the ZDBase class into others (mostly Layout2D).
 - Enabled the rules in the 3Dreams. Now it reads the ADF, bulids the expressions
   and use them to display the events in the nodes. Now 3Dreams is fully operative

- Some clean up stuff done: dead code has been removed and some unused
  files removed.

- To improve the compiling time required to compile the whole code, some
  class forwarding has been added in the headers in order to reduce the
  number of files included in the different classes. We'll see if some
  improvement has been done...

- Added the statistics and object size functions to all the dral database
  classes in order to know exactly the amount of memory used in the database
  and also how this memory is wasted.

- Now the internal tags (like __colorxx) are not shown when the tags of a slot
  are shown to the user.

- All the shared QT iterators have been changed to local iterators (avoids
  possible problems if an iteration is stopped and the new called subroutine
  also touches the shared iterator.

- Now the tag handlers are deleted after all the colors and shapes are computed
  (some MB where occupied unnecessary).

- Changed the TrackIDNode class in order to reduce the amount of memory
  needed in cases that a huge number of slots are tracked. To avoid allocating
  a lot of TagIdVecNode, a rename of the tags used in a given track node is
  done so only the exact number of tag id nodes are allocated. This is done
  using a growing vector for both the rename table and the vector with the
  tag id nodes.

- Added the template class GVector and TagRenameTable.

- WARNING: I mixed the checkout in the previous commit and I committed a none
  working check-out. This one is a merge of both of them.

- The changes are the ones wrote in the previous entry and also some improvements
  in the way that dral DB knows the track id and which slots are tracked. Now a
  whole node or edge is tracked (all the slots), so only functions to track the
  entire element are provided. To know the track id of a given slot, a resolve
  track id functions are provided. This change will speed up the resolve process
  and also occupies less memory in cases that huge structures (such caches) are
  used.

- WARNING: now dreams doesn't work correctly, but at least compiles. ASAP a correct
  version will be comitted.

  item tag is not defined. Now it is solved. Also the NodeSlot class
  didn't compute well the linear position.

 - Corrected an asserion that is raised when the cursor is placed in the
   frontier of two rectangles and a cell description description is requested.
   Changed the assertion by a null description.

 - Implemented the error check in the ADF2.5 "if" description when an no
   existing tag is used.

- Added a new tag in the ADF tag description: now a tag can be defined
  as autoflush, meaning that the value of the tag just lasts for one cycle.
  For instance, if a value is set in cycle 10, in cycle 11 no value will
  be defined for the given tag.

- The compute system of colors and shapes has been changed in order to support
  huge structures such caches. This structures have a lot of slots to compute
  but almost all of them evaluate each cycle with the same color, because neither
  the slot tags nor the item tags change. To take advantage of this property now
  the compute engine only recomputes the evaluation when something changes in
  slot (a slot tag, the item inside the slot (actually is a slot tag), or an item
  tag of the item inside). Now the efficiency of color computing in 3Dreams and
  2Dreams has clearly improved.

- To implement the previous method we coded a new class called TagFlipHandler that
  implements a function that returns a sequential access to the tags of a slot that
  change their values. This function returns the changes in cycle order, so we
  can skip the computing of all the cycles that are between the actual change and the
  following one.

- To implement the previous class all the tag vec classes now implement a new method
  called skipToNextCycleWithChange, that returns the cycle when the value of the tag
  changes.

- Also DBListener has been fixed to remove a bug with the start activity callback.

 - Finished implementation of letter support amongst Layout2D classes and ColorShape caches
   The 2D view now accepts rules with letters in the ADF and reacts accordingly. A significant
   effort when on the libAGT in order to achieve decent quality visualization of the text
   across different zooming scales.

- Bug fixed in Layout2DMultiRow: unprotected call to getColorShape() could lead to assert failure,
  need to verify if some VALID colorIdx was returned

- Bug fixed in Layout2DRow: in the event of >255 color/shape/letter combinations the 'expection' mechanism
  is used, the row used at creation time was inconsistent with the one used at refresh time and hence
  an assert failure was raised

- changed the definition of Q_ASSERT when the fatal flag is on, now the Q_ASSERT produces an abort
  so gdb can be used to inspect the stack.

 - Added Letter support to Layout3D, now letter rules can be added to the ADF
   and the viewer will draw them accordingly
 
 - Fixed a bug in Layout3DRectangle related with the insertion of color/shape,
   the wrong physical coordinates were used and hence the expection mechanism for
   nodes with >256 combinations was not workng.

- We found some performance problems in the CSL compute of huge 3Dreams structures
  such caches. The problem becomes visible when almost all the slots are filled and
  all the cycles a color is added to the DB. To solve this problem we now store the
  colors with forwarding vectors instead of non-forwarding vectors, so now just one
  call is done per color calculation.

- We have modified the names of some tag vector classes and also added the undefine
  functions.

- The computeCSL functions have been changed to work correctly with the new forwarding
  color vectors.

 - Added support to font-color attributes, now a set statement can
   include the color for the letter.

- Fixed fill color transparency support (was completely broken both in 2D and 3D)
    - fixed definition of CSLData::getDefined() to take border color and letter into account
    - fixed the ADFParser 2.5 to actually check the transparency parameter of the returned CSLData
    - added transparency support to ColorShapeItem
    - fixed Layout2DRow and Layout3DRectangle to take transparency into account

  function to the TagVec that haven't been compressed yet, skipping the unnecessary call
  to the already compressed vectors.

- Redefined the Q_ASSERT as an abort so now gdb is able to show the backtrace
  when the assert fails. This is the same change that Fede did in the Dreams code
  but now it's extended to the database.

- Fixed a bug in the tracking of the edges: when an edge was defined with latency
  zero, none track was allocated because all the tracks for the edge were allocated
  using a for(latency) { for(bandwidth) {} }. To fix this a QMAX with the latency
  and 1 is performed, so this problem is solved.

- Fixed a bug in TagIdVec introduced in the last commit. We supposed that firstCycle
  was a 32 bit integer, but after the commit it was changed to a 20 bit integer. This
  introduced a bug in the initialization process, because it tried to set the biggest
  positive integer for 32 bits, which is a -1 for a 20 bit integer.

- Added support for multi clock traces. Support for different clocks has been added
  in the different layers of the dral DB. By now it only has been tested with traces
  without multi clock and they still load without crashes.

- This support only allows static frequencies for all the elements of the database
  (nodes, edges and items), hence if a node or an item tries to change to another
  clock domain an assert will raise.

- ClockDomainMgr is a new class that stores all the information of the different clock
  domains that the trace creates.

 Added support for new rule language. 
 
 This is a partial commit: for now, you can ONLY test the new language
 inside a <rectangle> command.  Here's an example using the new rules: 

   <rectangle node="DBUFFER{0}" geometry="16x8">
       <set color="violet" /> 
       <layout>
           <dimension value="h"/>
           <dimension value="8x8"/>
       </layout>
       <rule>
        if ( itag("VPC") > 0x2aabf ) { color = "blue"; }
        if ( itag("TYPE") == "M"  )   { shape = "diamond"; }
        if ( itag("TYPE") == "I"  )   { shape = "triangle"; }
        if ( itag("TYPE") =~ "B"  )   { shape = "circle"; } 
       </rule>
   </rectangle>

 The old rules are still working, BTW.

 You can take a look at the supported language in parser.yy and lexer.ll

 - commited rudimentary code fot waterfall view support. events can be
   visualized but color and filtering based on expression is WIP.
   
 - fixed a problem with ColorShapeItema dn CSLData classes. Now both
   have 'set' mask bits so that the viewer can know if a color_fill
   attribute was left undefined by the ADF. I also made black default
   colors so no random color can ever be displayed. A redish cross
   patter fill bursh was added as defualt warning style for 2D/3D when
   non initialized color is detected due to poorly written ADF.

 - added missing .cvsignore files for Makefile/Makefile.in files

   on the waterfall view.
   Only the new rule style is supported. No default/override rules
   yet.
   
 - Fixed a masking problem in the CSLData based constructor for ColorShapeItem

 - Fixed a small buf in the flex definition for rules: fcolor is NOT fill color,
    fcolor is FONT color, (fill color is and always was plain 'color').

- Added some new stuff to enable the clock server support: just for backward
  compatibility, if a trace doesn't define a clock for the nodes, a default
  clock is created and all the parent are set with this default clock.

- Fixed a bug in the function that returned the clock domain of a node. Before,
  if the clock was requested and it was not set, an assert was rose. Now, it
  behaves as it shoulds, and if the clock is not set in the node, it requests
  the clock to its parent, and so on. If a root node doesn't have the clock set,
  then an assert is rose.

- Added some const to functions that just returned values to the classes
  DBGraphNode, DBGraphEdge, ItemTagHeap and ItemHandler.

- Fixed a bug in DBListener in the new cycle callback. The currentClockDomain
  variable was used before updating it with the new domain, so all the reads
  and writes were done to the previous domain and not the new domain.

- Added a new function to the ItemHandler that skips all the events and tags
  of the item pointed by the handler until a given cycle. This function is
  called goToCycle.

- Now the LCM of the different clock domains is computed by the ClockDomainMgr
  and also the relative ratio to the LCM is set in the different entries.

- Now the ItemTagHeap support events with different clock domains. By now, the
  maximum number of different clock domains is 8, but in a future this can be
  extended if needed. This information is stored within the 64 bit that each
  event or tag occupies, so, by now, the entry of type clock domain change is
  removed.

- Fixed a bug in ADFParser1, 2 and 2.5: ExpressionEqual was used when
  ExpressionCompare should be used instead.

 - Added "map" support in language. Here is an example rule using the %
   operator and a shadetable name "temper" previously defined:

                 color = map(itag("DID") % 100, temper, 0, 100);

 - Added fading in the 3Dreams display. Currently activatign fading causes
   all color components (letter, border and fill) to be faded. Waiting for
   Santi's generalization with filters. Current syntax example:

            if ( stag(HIT) == 0 )
            { 
              letter           = 'm'; 
              color [fade=30]  = red;
            }

 - Added new operators: UnaryMinus, itag(), stag(), ctag(), ntag(), fp64() and int64()

 - Added support for mixed INT/FP arithmetic. The language promotes
   everything to FP64 by default if you mix things. Use the int64()

- The update bar mechanism was changed because when something was emitted
  (for instance a cycle change) from one window to the others, all the windows
  updated the state of the bars with their own content. To solve this I added
  a new condition that was that only the focused window was allowed to update
  the bar. Now seems that some events (like highlighting) makes a window lose
  the focus. I added a setFocus to catch the focus again.

- When a waterfall tab is specified with an order by, a blank line is added
  between the changes of value of the order tag (requested by CSI guys that are
  the only ones using waterfall by now, when needed different behaviour a new
  ADF tag will be added to choose between adding a line (or more) and doing
  nothing at all).

- Changed the implementation of the ItemTabWidget of WaterFall. The previous
  version was using a QTable which had a big problem when the zoom was changed.
  It seems that the resizing of all the cells took N*lgN or N*N time making
  this widget unpractical when the number of items in the tab was bigger than
  a few thousands. Now a custum widget (ItemTabWidgetColumn) is used to write
  all the values of a Column without paying any computation cost when the zoom
  is changed.

- ItemTabWidget didn't update the row height every time that the scaling
  factor (zoom) was changed. This bug ended up with some scroll problems
  if a zoom in was done.

- Changed the behaviour of the ItemTabWidget when an item don't have defined
  a tag that is shown in this widget: before a red square was painted, now
  a undefined red text is shown instead.

- Some times the application crashed when a DRL was closed. Seems like calling
  a processEvents before and after closing each mdi of the trace solves this
  problem.

- ExpressionSet type checking function didn't call the type check of its own
  expressions. If one of its expressions had a type check problem the situation
  was not detected and the program ended up in some random crashes.

- No class was deleting the created expressions. ADFParser now is the one
  that deletes the parsed expressions.

- Added some destructor to expression classes that didn't delete all the
  allocated objects.

- After the computation of each cell the progress bar was updated, so P14
  watch windows needed several seconds to be computed just because a lot of
  cells are displayed (but they have little activity). Now the bar is updated
  after several cells are computed, so all the process is quite more faster.

- Implemented a new usefull feature for comparing two traces: the user
  can right-click over a resource view (2Dreams) event and request to
  synchronize to that item. The application gets the name of the edge
  where the item is located and also the value of this item for the
  "item sync tag" (a combo box next to highlighting tag specifies which
  is this tag). All the other resource views that are locked are moved
  to the position where an event with the same value for the selected
  tag appears in a row of an edge with the same name. If the tag is not
  defined or the edge doesn't exist or no item is found a warning is
  presented to the user.
  If a user is comparing 2 traces can easily find where a given instruction
  is commited in the other trace just calling this feature in the retire
  edge of the base trace.

- Two functions of ItemHandler had an argument of type TagValueBase badly coded
  as INT16. When corrected to TagValueBase some classes didn't compile cause
  the parameter passed when called didn't match. They've been changed to
  the correct type.

- When a find in resource view changed the folding state the ascrollview was
  not resized, so not all the rows could be viewed.

- Folding state of resource view was not repainted when the window was moved
  due a panning of another resource view when the panning is locked.

- Added some new behaviour options in the highlighting double-clicking
  the dis dock window. When a double click is done over an item, the
  highlighting pops the last highlight and pushes a new one if the ctrl
  is not pressed. If so, the last highlight is not pop. The old behaviour
  was that the 2dreams window was moved to the first appearance of the
  double-clicked item, now only if the shift is pressed the window is moved
  (if not pressed, the window is not moved).

- When a highlighting is done in the 2dreams and is synchronized with the
  dis dock win, the current highlight tag is used as the synchronization
  tag and not the ITEM_ID as was done before.

- Moved all the files with widgets that are docked windows to
  the directory dockwin. For each type of dock window a new
  subdirectory has been added. Also EventDockWin has been renamed
  to TagDockWin.

- Created a new dock window called PushoutDockWin that can be used
  to compute the retirement pushout and other similar utilities.
  It's still under development, so no functionality at all is
  provided.

- Fixed a bug in WatchWindow that ended up in some program crashes
  when the watchwindow submenu with all the nodes were displayed
  and that also sometimes showed incorrect values in the screen.

- Added support for traces that don't finish correctly: now Dreams
  is able to show the information, instead of just aborting the
  loading as was done before.

- Several bugs corrected in the track heap...

- The TagVecValue64 was never compressed because an if condition
  inside had a bug and always returned itslef instead of a dense
  version. As this vector is the most used, the track heap was
  never compressed.

- The TagVec class (interface of all TagVec* classes) didn't have
  a virtual destructor class, so when a TagVec subclass object was
  destroyed, only the compiler created destructor of TagVec was
  called and all the space allocated by the sub-class was not freed.

- After fixing this bugs, when the track heap was compressed it take
  a while to do the job, because now the vectors that were compressed
  were destroied. If the delete call was commented, the time needed
  to compress the heap wasn't noticeble. I tried to take advantage of
  the work flow of the track heap: first allocates expanded vectors, when
  the end of the chunk is reached creates compressed versions of the
  expanded vectors, then destroys them and starts to allocate more
  expanded vectors that will be used in the next chunk. As can be easily
  seen, we can skip the two last steps of deleting and later creating
  expanded vectors, so now the expanded vectors that should be deleted
  are added at one list of free vectors and when a new vector is needed
  a vector of the list is used. At the end of the loading process all the
  none-used vectors are purged.

- Added a new right-button tool in all the views that lets the user
  synchronize all the views that belong to the same trace than the active
  one.

- Several bugs found when the sync to cycle tool was called when more
  than one trace was opened.

- Now the relationship scan beziers are not copied to other resource views
  and when the folding state is changed all the lines are removed.

- Solved some problems with the hasFocus state of the views. They used this
  state to know when they can change the status bar and when not. The hasFocus
  function was not working correctly, so it has been changed to a manual
  comparison that works flawlessly.

- Added a new slot tool in 3Dreams that lets the user open the 
  Watch Window associated to the node of the slot.

- When a Watch Window is maximized, if a column size is changed,
  the size of the widget is not automatically resized, because it
  caused some problems.

- Added the Makefile.am machinery to make vcgDreams tool to compile by default

- Also fixed a few warnings in the code due to non virtual destructors...
- Removed the -Winline from the Dreams and vcgDreams tools since current implementation
  lead to a lot of functions not being inlinded (and hence a lot of warnings)
- Added the new Dreams Quattro logo     
- Commited some old changes in doxugen dreams tutorial

- In some cases Dreams is able to load traces with errors. The case that
  the load ended but the EndSimulation function was not called was not
  covered, so some variables ended up with undefined values and Dreams
  crashed. Now, after loading the trace, Dreams requests if the trace don't
  have fatal errors; when this function is called checks that the
  EndSimulation was called and otherwise calls it to set all the undefined
  variables.

- In the last change I forgot that IOMgr calls the function to know if
  an error has raised in order to stop ASAP the loading of invalid traces.
  The problem is that with this last change the call also finished the
  trace... so I added a boolean to call the EndSimulation or not.

Added a --enable-distcc switch to ./configure to enable use 
of distcc as the C and C++ compiler.

Used together with the CONFIGFLAGS flag in awb.config one can 
use asim-shell to automatically generate a Makefile that uses 
distcc.

Removed couple of Makefiles that are generated by configure and
so shouldn't be in CVS.

- Added some changes to make the code gcc 3.4 compatible

- When StartActivity was called it didn't call any cycle function
  in order to start the trace. So now, when this callback is called,
  it internally calls the clock domain with id 0 with the cycle passed
  as a parameter and phase 0.

- Added a check in the Cycle callback that asserts that the clockid
  is within the range

- TagIdVec had an error when accessing to its AEVectors: it didn't check
  if a given index was allocated, so when it accessed it the AEVector returned
  garbage and ended with a segmentation fault

- As this is the second bug today related to accesses to uninitialized
  positions in AEVectors, I've added some asserts to check this, but by
  now they don't seem to work. I'll fix this soon.

- Changed some redundant calls in the computeCSL of floorplan

  so this view never updated the cycle bar as this comparison was always
  false

  defined in the ADF
- Increased the range of characters that can be assigned in the letter
  field of an event
- If a setnodetag to a slot had a number of dimensions different than
  the definition of the slot, the command was just ignored. Now an
  error is raised
- Solved out a problem with groups defined without rows (program crashed)

- Dreams had some performance problem handling colors defined
  with strings. Looks like creating a QColor with a string name
  raises an X protocol to know exactly what is the final color
  that dramatically slowed down the color computing phase. Now
  we've implemented a cache mechanism that just computes the
  color one time and reuses for later accesses, with significant
  speed-ups.

 LayoutResourceRow.cpp     Locally Modified          308

- Cleaned some files with dos2unix
- Fixed some minor memory leaks in the creation of dialogs
- StrTable was using an integer of 16 bit instead of 32 bits
  to assign values to strings. So no more than 65536 string
  values were supported.
- ResourceView was drawing an extra cycle if all the trace
  could be drawn in the screen. This ended up in misleading
  information drawn and a crash if an element in this extra
  cycle was highlighted.
- Erased a useless check in the moveitem callback.
- Now when an item is moved through an edge during a clock
  domain different than the destination node of the edges,
  dreams reports an error to the user and not an ASSERT
  violation of the program.
- Now event and tag dialogs if sorted by cycle uses a real
  cycle sorting rather than a string sort (clock domain is
  also used, so 28@1.0GHz is greater than 30@2.0GHz).
- Chaned some names in the ShowTag flow to match more precisely
  to what the function is doing.
- Some tagdialog files have been moved from the root to its
  subdirectory.

- a layoutwaterfall name was misleading, so we changed it
- found a bug in getRowItemId in layout waterfall: no row limit
  was check and q QValueVector was used to know the item id (and
  this structure also doesn't check the limit), so the program
  crashed if out of bounds access was done

 - Lots of changes. Too many to explain here. The most important ones
 are bugfixes and the fact that now most info is given in ns instead of
 cycles.

 - I'm committing Loki lib which is a non-Intel one that I'm using
 for this tool. Don't think it should be added here, but it'll do
 the work.

  already deleted by the context menu itself.

 - Changed strToUINT64 function. Now using stdlib's strtoull. I had
 coded mine, which was pretty bad 'cause it didn't offer support for
 octal or hex. Now it does.

- Changed names in ViewChoiceDialog: 2D to Resource, etc.
- Added a timeout in the ViewChoiceDialog so now if the user
  doesn't do anything in 10 seconds the trace starts to load
  automatically.
- Moved the Color/Shape match sentences from row info to
  event info in resource view.
- Fixed a bug in ExpressionIf: no empty then statement was
  supported

- Fixed bug that was causing segfault on some queries

- Added another input mode, 'command line';  allows you to run your tdreams commands from the shell.  
If there is a second argument on the command line and it isn't a file, tdreams assumes it isn't 
a batch file but instead it is a command line to execute.  Ex:  tdreams Events.drl.gz "dumpworse all 4"

- Added more DEBUG() macros to existing cout's

- Checking for selectors.xml and config.xml in ~/.asim/ as well as the current directory.
The version in the current directory still has priority. 

- Added a new output mode: columns and the ability to set the default textmode via config.xml
    <parameter name="default-textmode" value="columns"/>

- Tracking nodes entered/exited via MoveItems, rather than just EnterNode
This is off by default for now until I'm sure it doesn't break other things
    <parameter name="parse-moveitems" value="true"/>

 - Fixed a problem on Dreams makefile regarding flex and bison files: the output of flex and bison were not deleted on male clean, so changes on .yy/.ll files or bison/flex versions were not observed by the compilation process.

 - Removed deprecated 2dreams from automatic compilation (code still there)
 - Removed automatic compilation of Dral2PTV (code still there)
 - Fixed minor bugs on TDreams leading to compilation problems (using gcc 3.4.3)
 - Protected some definitions on DralDBSyntax.h to avoid duplicated definitions

 With all these fixes I was able to compile on:

 - gcc 3.3.2 + bison 2.0
 - gcc 3.4.3 + bison 2.0

 Notes: 
 a) ASIM-Core compiles but with lots of warnings
 b) dreams compiles but gives some link warning messages: in particular the qt uses libc 5 while the rest of the code libc 6, it seems to work ok though.

Log message:	CSN: CSN-dreams-342


The dralTranslator has been extended in order to be able to normalize the cycle numbers located in a trace. This has been done in order to avoid problems when loading traces to dreams with larger cycle numbers (i.e: > 2 M). With this extension two new knobs are specified: the first one specifies the amount of cycles that have to be subtracted to the cycle number, and the second specifies the frequency assumed for this cycle count. If other frequencies are used in the dreams the cycle offset will be scaled according the clock domain and the previous cycle offset. 

Cycle_clock_M = cycle_from_trace - offset_baseline*(freq_clock_M/freq_baseline)

Some changes to get dreams to build on Ubuntu. Added new places
to look for qt3 and missing file ylwrap. 1Dreams now seems
to build but Dreams has problems with libtool among other
things.
