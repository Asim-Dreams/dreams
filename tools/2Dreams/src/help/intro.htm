<h2>What's 2Dreams?</h2>
2Dreams is a customizable performance visualization tool based on the <a
 href="dral.htm">DRAL Abstractions</a> 2Dreams reads both ASCII and binary
DRAL files (*.drl) and represents the movements of items along the DRAL-Edges
as events on screen. An event is typically drawn as a color filled rectangle.
The X-axis represents time (on a cycle basis) and the rows are used to allocate
the different edges of the DRAL-Graph. Events can be draw with different colors
and shapes (rectangle, diamond, triangle, etc), to graphically express different
behaviours. The position (row) each DRAL-Edge uses and the shape and colors
used to represent behaviour is taken from a configuration file called ADF
(<a href="adf.htm">Architecture Definition File</a>). <br>

<h2>What is 2Dreams intended for?</h2>
2Dreams is aimed to ease the performance and behaviour analysis of pipelined
systems, mainly microprocessors and networks of processors.<br>
<br>
<h2>Some History</h2>
The basic functionality and underlying concepts have been inherited from a
previous ASIM Cycle Display written in Tcl/Tk for the Aranha model. This new
implementation keeps the visualization philosophy of the previous version
but works with a different approach. 2Dreams was designed to fit common needs
of microprocessors performance analysis and is customizable to virtually any
processor family. 2Dreams uses an abstract language (<a href="dral.htm">DRAL</a>)
to obtain the trace information and yet another abstract specification language
(<a href="adf.htm">ADF</a>) to transform these traces in visual information.<br>
