        Custom selectors can be specified as a combination of specific selectors. This is simply done by adding a selector entry in selectors.xml file.
        <example>
        <title>Probe requests selector</title>
        <literallayout>
            <![CDATA[
            <selector name="probes">
                <info>Probe requests</info>
                <enters nodename="IPQ"/>
            </selector>
            ]]>
        </literallayout>
        </example>
    </para>
    <para>
        The primitives selectors that can be used are the following:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                enters: selects transactions that enter a given node. Valid attributes are nodename and instance. 
                A nodename can map to various nodes (node instances). However, a nodename and an specific instance
                determine at most one node.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                not-enters: selects all but the transactions that would be selected by the corresponding "enters" selector.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                starts: selects transactions that start in a given node. Valid attribute is nodename. 
                A nodename can map to various nodes (node instances). 
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                not-starts: selects all but the transactions that would be selected by the corresponding "enters" selector.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                ends: selects transactions that start in a given node. Valid attribute is nodename. 
                A nodename can map to various nodes (node instances). 
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                not-ends: selects all but the transactions that would be selected by the corresponding "enters" selector.
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
        Apart from that, information on the selector can be added using the tag <![CDATA[<info/>]]>. 
        This information will be displayed as an entry in the help.
