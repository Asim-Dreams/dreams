<h1 align="center">2Dreams Preferences</h1>
<br>
2Dreams is customizable in several ways. To access the preferences
dialogs click on Tools/Preferences. You will find four tabs (TAGS,
DBase, File and General) in the dialog. In the following sections, we
describe the functionality of each of those tabs. Some preferences are
saved and updated automatically. For instance, the position and size of
the different windows and toolbars are tracked by default. If for some
reason you need to change by hand some of those properties edit the file
~/.qt/2dreamsrc in Unix systems or look for BSSAD/2Dreams prefix in the
register in Windows systems.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="TAGS_Section"></a>TAGS Section</h2>
In the TAGS Section, you can manage the Favourite Tag List and the
Relationship tracking Tag. The Favourite Tags are used in the Tag Window
(right bottom corner of Figure 1) if "Show Only Favorite Tags" is
enabled (see <a href="#Behaviour_Section">Behaviour Section</a>) and in
the Highlight criterion selector (top toolbar). The Relationship
tracking tag is used to track for relations between items (see <a
 href="advanced.htm">Advanced Features</a>). The zoom icon is active
only when an event file is loaded and allows you to select one of the
used tags in the event file. Bear in mind that the selected tag <b>must</b>
be of the type <span style="font-style: italic;">set of values</span>
and each value <b>must </b>be a valid item identifier.<br>

<h2>DBase Section</h2>
In the DBase section, you will find four sliders to change the amount
of space (memory) used for the internal database. The maximum number of
cycles is self-explanatory. The Tag Heap and Mutable Tag Heap sizes can
be increased if the number of items or the amount of related information
(tags) is higher than the expected (you will get an error message in
this case when loading the event file). The symbol table size limits the
number of string tags (like disassembly).<br>

<h2>File Section</h2>
In the File Section, you can change the location of the log file used
by 2Dreams and specify a default ADF (see <a href="adf.htm">What's an
ADF</a>). You can also enable a DTD checking. Note that 2Dreams is not
able to perform such a checking so you will need some external tool
(like xmllint). Web connectivity to intranet server aforge.shr.intel.com
is also required to access the DTD.<br>

<h2>Appearence Section</h2>
In this section, you will find some common appearance settings
(background color, font size, etc) and grid lines configuration. Grid
lines are mainly implemented for some planified features extensions. <br>

<h2><a name="Behaviour_Section"></a>Behaviour Section</h2>
In this section you have two check boxes. The Automatic purge option,
if enabled, forces the "delete item" command of all the live items when
the end of the events<br>
file is reached (or loading stoped by user). If the Tag Window option
is cheked only the Favorite Tags (see <a href="#TAGS_Section">TAGS
Section</a>)will be shown in the Tag Window, otherwise all the<br>
item tags are shown.<br>
